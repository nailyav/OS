output 1:
Hello world
Hello world

output 2:
Hello world
		// empty line
		// empty line

the difference between two outputs:
printf() is buffered and the buffer is not flushed until a new line is printed. when forking a process 
in the program 1 the child process inherits every part of the parent process, including the output buffer.
but in the program 2 when a new line is printed the buffer is flushed and a child process does not 
inherit the "Hello world" string from the parent process
